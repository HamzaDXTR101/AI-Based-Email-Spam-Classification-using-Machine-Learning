Project: Email Spam Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Description:
The Email Spam Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm  project provides a robust solution for classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to train a classification model on a dataset obtained from Kaggle's Spam Email Classification Dataset. The project aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted or malicious emails, enhancing email management and reducing the risk of users falling victim to spam or phishing attacks.

Key Features:

Imports the email dataset from a specified file path in Google Drive, allowing users to easily use their own dataset.
Preprocesses the text data by performing optional steps such as removing stopwords, applying stemming/lemmatization, and handling missing values, enhancing the quality of the classification model.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Applies CountVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical feature vectors, preparing it for training the Naive Bayes classifier.
Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training set, leveraging the algorithm's ability to handle discrete features like word counts efficiently.
Makes predictions on the test set using the trained classifier and calculates the accuracy of the model.
Provides insights into the dataset by counting the number of spam and ham emails, giving users a better understanding of the data distribution.
Displays example spam and ham emails, allowing users to observe the classification results and evaluate the model's performance qualitatively.
Usage:

Download the email dataset from the Kaggle URL (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset).
Upload the dataset to your Google Drive and note the file path.
Import the necessary libraries and mount your Google Drive in Google Colab using the provided code.
Load the dataset by specifying the file path and read it into a pandas DataFrame.
Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y) for classification.
Optionally, preprocess the text data by applying techniques such as removing stopwords or handling missing values.
Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.
Vectorize the text data using CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training set using the fit method.
Make predictions on the test set using the trained classifier's predict method.
Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels using the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics.
Obtain additional insights by counting the number of spam and ham emails in the dataset.
Display a sample of spam and ham emails for qualitative analysis.
